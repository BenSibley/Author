#. Description of the plugin/theme
msgid ""
"Author is designed for publishers who want readers. That's why Author is "
"fast, responsive, accessibility-ready, and optimally designed for reading. "
"All scripts and stylesheets are minified, concatenated, and conditionally "
"loaded to maximize performance. The layout adapts fluidly to all screen "
"sizes to enhance usability. As one of few accessibility-ready themes, it "
"performs well for users with wide ranges of disabilities. Lastly, based on "
"the ancient Van de Graaf canon, Author is optimally designed for reading. "
"Author is the theme your content deserves. See our fully setup live demo "
"here: https://www.competethemes.com/author-live-demo/"
